# COVID-19-Excel-dashboards
The new files are updated to conform with the new data structures in the two underlying databases. 

These files load daily updates from github depositories for the development of the COVID-19 virus in 
* Italy (national, regional and provincial statistics), based on https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19
* The world, using and molding the CCSE database, https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series

I have calculated daily trends and cases/million as these stats are more representative.
